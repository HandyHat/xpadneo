# Changes since v0.8.2 up to v0.8.3

The previous release was missing an important commit to tell the
different protocol modes of the controllers correctly apart.

# Changes since v0.8.1 up to v0.8.2

This release documents a few issues with latest SDL releases, works
around a libinput bug (which has been fixed upstream and should arrive
in your distribution at some time).

This release also features more precise handling of the thumb sticks
and an optional high-precision mode which can be activated via a module
parameter and is intended only for usage primarily in Proton games.
Efforts are currently being done to migrate this fix to SDL and Proton
itself so in a future release, you may longer need to use this mode
explicitly.

8BitDo controllers which are not 100% compatible with Xbox controllers,
and Xbox controllers that show up in Windows mode despite being
connected to Linux are handled properly now. This is actually a
situation that may occur in the controller firmware when swapped
between Windows and Linux regularly and appears to be a bug in the
firmware.


## Breaking Changes

This release fixes button mappings for 8BitDo controllers to actually
match their names on the controller instead of matching positions with
original Xbox controllers. The X,Y and A,B buttons will be swapped
compared to previous versions.


## Headlines:

  * hid-xpadneo, quirks: We need to carry a quirk for Linux button mappings
  * xpadneo, deadzones: Implement a high-precision mode without dead zones
  * xpadneo, udev: Work around libinput using the controller as touchpad

# Changes since v0.8 up to v0.8.1

The previous version removed the `disable_ff` module parameter. There is
now a full replacement to disable rumble completely by setting the rumble
attenuation to 100%. Use the module parameter `rumble_attenuation=100` to
completely disable rumble. Use `rumble_attenuation=0,100` or
`trigger_rumble_mode=2` to only disable the triggers. In the latter case
you don't need to set both.

The initial rumble notification won't be disabled by this. To also disable
the notification, use `ff_connect_notify=0`.

# Changes since v0.7 up to v0.8

*Quote of the day:*
> HID me baby, one more time!

Much hard work of several weeks has gone into this release, so there's a big
reason to say thanks to all contributors, be it testing, suggestions, bug
reporting, or - of course - programming.

Many thanks @medusalix for finally figuring out the underlying problems of
the disconnect behavior of the controller during rumble events: After some
internal discussion, we managed to find a race condition in the controller
firmware and worked around it by throttling the rumble reprogramming to
intervals of at least 10ms as this is what the controllers seems to accept
as the minimal interval without freaking out. As a "thank you", I contributed
a logically identical patch to the [xow](https://github.com/medusalix/xow)
project which has not been merged yet, tho. Check it out - it supports the
native dongle that comes with the controller!

Also, let's all say "thank you" to @ehats for contributing the Xbox Elite 2
series controller support. He started from zero to mastering the HID
internals in just a few days with just a little help from me. I'm sure, a
vast amount of effort, a steep learning curve, and a lot of endurance and
probably also one beer or another went into this work. Leave him some kudos
for this awesome contribution, and expect more to follow. His work builds
the base for adding profile support and customization into the next xpadneo
version. He qualified for the quote of the day above.

A handful patches have been contributed which fix some smaller bugs:

  * Thanks to Adam Becker for adding some bug and style fixes.
  * Lars-SÃ¶ren Steck fixed a scripting bug, thank you.
  * Manjaro users now see instructions for their favorite distribution,
    thanks to @snpefk.

Let's not forget our testers, who have patiently been with us during the
development of this milestone: We appreciate your work, patience, and
contributions.

Many of the bug fixes have been backported to the v0.7 branch which has now
received its end of life. If you're having problems with the new features,
please report that and use the v0.7 branch until that specific bug is fixed.


## Breaking Changes

This version removed some module parameters with only partial replacement.
One of those if `disable_ff` which can no longer be used. Instead, there's
a new parameter `trigger_rumble_mode` which can disable trigger rumble
only. The next update will include a new parameter to set rumble attenuation
to 100% which translates to no rumble at all.
